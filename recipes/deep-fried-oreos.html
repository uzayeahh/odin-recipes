    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Deep-fried Oreos are a carnival favorite where I grew up. Oreos get dipped into pancake batter and fried â€” yummy! You can do this with or without a deep fryer.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 quarts vegetable oil (frying)</li>
        <li>1 cup milk</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 cup pancake mix</li>
        <li>Oreos</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat oil in a deep fryer or large saucepan to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Whisk milk, egg, and 2 teaspoons of vegetable oil in a large bowl until smooth. Stir in the pancake mix until no dry lumps remain.</li>
        <li>Dip cookies into batter, one at a time, and carefully place into hot oil. Fry in batches, 4 or 5 at a time, until cookies are golden brown, about 2 minutes. Drain on a paper towel-lined plate before serving.</li>
    </ol>
